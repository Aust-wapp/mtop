# MTOP Operators

- Added `/dashboard/operators` and `/dashboard/operators/[id]`, with a sidebar
  entry directly below Applications.
- The directory lists franchises with an assigned MTOP number. Search by owner,
  MTOP number, or plate, status filtering, pagination, and ordering are applied
  in the Supabase query before the current page is returned.
- The shared franchise detail component provides the operator Overview,
  Transactions, and Activity tabs. Transactions link to their source
  applications; Activity uses the existing franchise audit and application
  history sources.
- Applications already reference the long-lived franchise through
  `franchise_id`; no duplicate operator entity or database migration was
  required.
- The directory sorts MTOP numbers newest first in the database query, before
  pagination.
